# ConSysT

Large scale distributed systems require to embrace the trade off
between consistency and availability, accepting lower levels of consistency
to guarantee higher availability.

Existing programming languages are, however, agnostic to this compromise,
resulting in consistency guarantees that are the same for the whole application
and are implicitly adopted from the middleware or hardcoded in configuration files.

**ConSysT** integrates availability in the design of an object-oriented language,
allowing developers to specify different consistency and isolation constraints
in the same application at the granularity of single objects.

This is a code example.

Pretty good.
