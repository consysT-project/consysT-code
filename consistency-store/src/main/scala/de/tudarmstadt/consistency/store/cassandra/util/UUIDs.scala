/**
	* Utility methods to help working with UUIDs, and more specifically, with time-based UUIDs
	* (also known as Version 1 UUIDs).
	* <h3>Notes on the algorithm used to generate time-based UUIDs</h3>
	* The algorithm follows roughly the description in RFC-4122, but with the following adaptations:
	* <ol>
	* <li>Since Java does not provide direct access to the host's MAC address, that information
	* is replaced with a digest of all IP addresses available on the host;</li>
	* <li>The process ID (PID) isn't easily available to Java either, so it is determined by one of the
	* following methods, in the order they are listed below:
	* <ol>
	* <li>If the System  property <code>{@value PID_SYSTEM_PROPERTY}</code> is set then the value to use as a PID
	* will be read from that property;</li>
	* <li>Otherwise, if a native call to {@link Native#processId() getpid()} is possible, then the PID
	* will be read from that call;</li>
	* <li>Otherwise, an attempt will be made to read the PID from JMX's
	* {@link ManagementFactory#getRuntimeMXBean() RuntimeMXBean}, which is a well-known,
	* yet undocumented "hack", since most JVMs tend to use the JVM's PID as part of that MXBean name;</li>
	* <li>If all of the above fails, a random integer will be generated and used as a surrogate PID.</li>
	* </ol>
	* </li>
	* </ol>
	*
	* @see <a href="https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-444">JAVA-444</a>
