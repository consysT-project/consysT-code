Current:

- information-flow analysis for replicated objects

- better integration of transactions



Future:

- collections of replicated objects

- information-flow type system for Scala

- investigate cyclic object structures

- investigate recursive methods

- compiler (extension) for .remote

- "standalone" transactions, i.e. transactions outside of methods
