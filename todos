Current:

- information-flow analysis for replicated objects

- better integration of transactions

- enable preprocessing



Future:

- collections of replicated objects

- information-flow type system for Scala

- investigate cyclic object structures

- investigate recursive methods

- compiler (extension) for .remote

- "standalone" transactions, i.e. transactions outside of methods

- partial replicas, i.e. replicas that do not have all objects.

- dynamic changes of consistency (?): If an object is used in a
defined way, then it's consistency guarantees are lowered. For example,
there can be methods that are using weaker consistency by default.
