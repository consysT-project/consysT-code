# Installation notes

For z3, you need to add the following files in the `lib` folder:
* com.microsoft.z3.jar
* libz3.so
* libz3java.so

These files are generated when installing [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) with the `--java` option.

Alternatively, you can use the provided `.backup` files that are already in the `lib` folder. These files have been built for 64bit-Linux.
